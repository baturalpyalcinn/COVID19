**For Comparitive Plots:** You can find comparitive plots of the countries in the world from [here.](March_24/Covid19_March_24_Plots.html)  
**For Forecast Study:** You can find forecast for some specific countries [here.](March_24/Covid19_March_24_Forecast.html)  
**For Turkey:** You can find plots and figures related to Turkey from [here.](March_24/Covid19_March_24_Turkey.html)   

**Some *updates*:**  
- I have added damped exponential smoothing method under the forecast section to estimate future total cases.
- I started to keep track of daily testing number for Turkey. You can see the plots under the Turkey section.  

My daily forecast for some countries by using damped exponential smoothing method. See the plots below!

[Here](Covid19_March_22.html) is the March 22 version of my work.  
**For Turkey:** You can find plots and figures related to Turkey from [here](Covid19_March_22_Turkey.html).  

*"Here is a new plot for Turkey depicting the capacity of the hospitals in Turkey and how long they can accomodate new patients under exponential growth. According to the plot, if the number of COVID 19 cases continue to grow exponentially, there will not be enough hospital beds until March 30th assuming that every patient will be hospitalized."*
