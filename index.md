**For Turkey:** You can find plots and figures related to Turkey from [here](Covid19_March_22_Turkey.html).  

*"Here is a new plot for Turkey depicting the capacity of the hospitals in Turkey and how long they can accomodate new patients under exponential growth. According to the plot, if the number of COVID 19 cases continue to grow exponentially, there will not be enough hospital beds until March 30th assuming that every patient will be hospitalized."*
